Set up github repository

Coded weights, child sex, mothers' education

Problem: couldn't code maternity leave for France, I need CONGMATPAR at 2 months and 1 year

Elfe data restructured: what a mess for data users

23 june 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Role modelling: coded who does chores, including with 3 categories variables:
      
      1 mother does it
      2 balanced
      3 father does it
      
      Matching variables in Elfe and MCS!
      
      Add division of labour outside the home? -> started working on this 24 june
      
      Add age 1 variables for Elfe?

Attitudes expectations: not matching, not sure how to compare MCS and Elfe variables...
coded as dummy variables mostly

Cleaned the variables script more, listing the variables I've created as I go

Children's access to resources: MCS done pretty much, started Elfe

24 june 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

If variables available in multiple waves, which do I choose?

Coded parents' employment, part-time work in Elfe
Coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe (start again here)
Missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

Coded children's hobbies in clubs in Elfe

25 june 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe

Sent email for missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

Realised there might be a SLIGHT problem when I structure the MCS data:

      28 mothers are partner respondents, 7 fathers are main respondents:
      will need to fix this in clean_mcs scripts, shouldn't be an issue, but better to fix it
      fix by adding condition that _m needs to be ADDRES00 = 1, and _p ADDRES00 = 2
      maybe find how to redistribute the mother partner interview as _m
      and the father main interview as _p,
      because right now, 28 _p's are actually mothers and 7 _m's are actually fathers
      eg. matters when coding the DCWRK00 work variables
