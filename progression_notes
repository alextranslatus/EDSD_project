## Set up github repository

## Coded weights, child sex, mothers' education

## Problem: couldn't code maternity leave for France, I need CONGMATPAR at 2 months and 1 year

## Elfe data restructured: what a mess for data users

# 23 june 2025

## Role modelling: coded who does chores, including with 3 categories variables:
1 mother does it
2 balanced
3 father does it

Matching variables in Elfe and MCS!

Add division of labour outside the home? -> started working on this 24 june
Add age 1 variables for Elfe?

## Attitudes expectations: not matching, not sure how to compare MCS and Elfe variables...
coded as dummy variables mostly

## Cleaned the variables script more, listing the variables I've created as I go

## Children's access to resources: MCS done pretty much, started Elfe

# 24 june 2025

## If variables available in multiple waves, which do I choose?

## Coded parents' employment, part-time work in Elfe
## Coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe (start again here)
## Missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

## Coded children's hobbies in clubs in Elfe
