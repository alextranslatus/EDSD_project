Set up github repository

Coded weights, child sex, mothers' education

Problem: couldn't code maternity leave for France, I need CONGMATPAR at 2 months and 1 year

Elfe data restructured: what a mess for data users

23 june 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Role modelling: coded who does chores, including with 3 categories variables:
      
      1 mother does it
      2 balanced
      3 father does it
      
      Matching variables in Elfe and MCS!
      
      Add division of labour outside the home? -> started working on this 24 june
      
      Add age 1 variables for Elfe?

Attitudes expectations: not matching, not sure how to compare MCS and Elfe variables...
coded as dummy variables mostly

Cleaned the variables script more, listing the variables I've created as I go

Children's access to resources: MCS done pretty much, started Elfe

24 june 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

If variables available in multiple waves, which do I choose?

Coded parents' employment, part-time work in Elfe
Coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe (start again here)
Missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

Coded children's hobbies in clubs in Elfe

25 june 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe

Sent email for missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

Realised there might be a SLIGHT problem when I structure the MCS data:

      28 mothers are partner respondents, 7 fathers are main respondents:
      will need to fix this in clean_mcs scripts, shouldn't be an issue, but better to fix it
      fix by adding condition that _m needs to be ADDRES00 = 1, and _p ADDRES00 = 2
      maybe find how to redistribute the mother partner interview as _m
      and the father main interview as _p,
      because right now, 28 _p's are actually mothers and 7 _m's are actually fathers
      eg. matters when coding the DCWRK00 work variables

How do I work with family structure?

      For example: for work status, whose status matters? both parents? the ones 
      living with the child?
      
Coded work status of parents for MCS: I ignored the items in the questionnaire for 
which the work status was unknown for the main parent
MCS had a contructed variable with more options than the ELFE variable: in 
particular MCS had options for mothers with no partner

Also, coding part time work: should I keep an NA for people who don't have jobs?
Should probably, but that would reduce the sample size... Keep an option 2 = no job?
Done

1 july 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Spent a lot of time on maternity etc leave. Conclusion: probably should look at
length of leave for both parents. I think in MCS it's sort of assumed that all
mothers take leave, it's more about how long and paid how. In elfe, we have info
on length of maternity leave at 2 months only, which is weird, it's like an idea
of how long it'll be? But then in subsequent surveys, I can keep checking if
they've changed plans and are still on leave.

        For fathers: in MCS, it's weird how many fathers say they've been on leave
        again, should I focus on length?
        
        I'll finish coding this variable when I have the complete elfe data

For some reason, 
> elfe[, wgt2m:= M02E_PONDREF]
Error in eval(jsub, SDenv, parent.frame()) : 
  object 'M02E_PONDREF' not found

while the rest is fine:
> elfe[, wgt1y:= A01E_PONDREF]
> elfe[, wgt2y:= A02E_PONDREF]
> elfe[, wgt3y:= A03E_PONDREF]
> elfe[, wgt5y:= A05E_PONDREF]

Started the 2_desc document to get summary statistics for both countries

Need family structure as a variable: done

Started coding the summary statistics

Fix the MCS weights/present in waves variables
