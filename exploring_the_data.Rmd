In this document, I **compile all of the variables** that could be used to describe families in their attitudes and practices parenting boys and girls.

For all variables in this document:

-   I provide **tabulations**

-   I run **cohort member's sex t-tests** to check whether parents answered individual questions differently depending on the cohort member's sex

-   I run **SES anovas** to check whether parents answered individual questions differently depending on SES: to represent SES, I chose socio-economic classification of mothers' occupations (manager, intermediate occupations, small employers, routine occupations, etc.). These classifications are slightly different for France and the UK.

**The first section shows a small selection of variables** I thought were comparable (to a certain extent) in both cohorts **to describe three dimensions of parenting**:

-   the division of household labour and child care

-   the attitudes parents hold: what do they hope for their child's future, what do they want to instill in them

-   the child's activities: physical activities, counting, reading, etc.

Other variables could be more relevant, so **the second section of this document shows tabulations, t-tests and anovas for all of the variables**.

Here's an example of what you'll find throughout:

First the tabulations for a group of variables with similar themes:

```{r}
names_list <- c(
  "APCHNA00_m" = "9mMum Most responsibility for changing nappies",
  "APGEUP00_m" = "9mMum Most responsibility for getting up in night"
)

labels_list <- list(
  "APCHNA00_m" = c("-9" = "Refusal", "-8" = "Don't Know", "-1" = "Not applicable", "1" = "I do most of it", "2" = "My spouse does most of it", "3" = "We share more or less equally", "4" = "Someone else does it", "5" = "Does not apply"),
  "APGEUP00_m" = c("-9" = "Refusal", "-8" = "Don't Know", "-1" = "Not applicable", "1" = "I do most of it", "2" = "My spouse does most of it", "3" = "We share more or less equally", "4" = "Someone else does it", "5" = "Does not apply"))

for (var in names(names_list)) {
    tabulate_mcsvariable(var)
}

```

Followed by the t-tests: **I only show the variables for which the difference is significant at the 5%.**

(Sorry for the legibility issues here...)

In this example, we see that, depending on having a boy or a girl, parents provide different answers about who has most responsibility for getting up at night, but not about who has most responsibility for changing nappies.

Until I've recoded the variables properly, the means can be difficult to interpret for some of the variables.

```{r}

filtered_vars <- filter_positive_mcsvars(names(labels_list), mcs)
sex_mcsttest(filtered_vars)

```

Followed by the anovas: Again, **I only show the variables for which the difference is significant at the 5%.**

In this example, we see that on the whole parents from different social classes answer these two questions differently.

```{r}
ses_mcsanova(filtered_vars)
```

As I expected, responses vary a lot more by SES than by child's sex.
