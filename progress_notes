Set up github repository

Coded weights, child sex, mothers' education

Problem: couldn't code maternity leave for France, I need CONGMATPAR at 2 months 
and 1 year

Elfe data restructured: what a mess for data users

23 June 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Role modelling: coded who does chores, including with 3 categories variables:
      
      1 mother does it
      2 balanced
      3 father does it
      
      Matching variables in Elfe and MCS!
      
      Add division of labour outside the home? -> started working on this 24 
      June
      
      Add age 1 variables for Elfe?

Attitudes expectations: not matching, not sure how to compare MCS and Elfe
variables...
coded as dummy variables mostly

Cleaned the variables script more, listing the variables I've created as I go

Children's access to resources: MCS done pretty much, started Elfe

24 June 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

If variables available in multiple waves, which do I choose?

Coded parents' employment, part-time work in Elfe
Coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe (start again here)
Missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

Coded children's hobbies in clubs in Elfe

25 June 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished coding parents' reason for part-time work in Elfe

Sent email for missing variables for coding maternity (etc) leave in Elfe

Realised there might be a SLIGHT problem when I structure the MCS data:

      28 mothers are partner respondents, 7 fathers are main respondents:
      will need to fix this in clean_mcs scripts, shouldn't be an issue, but 
      better to fix it:
      fix by adding condition that _m needs to be ADDRES00 = 1, and _p 
      ADDRES00 = 2
      maybe find how to redistribute the mother partner interview as _m
      and the father main interview as _p,
      because right now, 28 _p's are actually mothers and 7 _m's are actually 
      fathers
      eg. matters when coding the DCWRK00 work variables

How do I work with family structure?

      For example: for work status, whose status matters? both parents? the ones 
      living with the child?
      
Coded work status of parents for MCS: I ignored the items in the questionnaire 
for which the work status was unknown for the main parent
MCS had a contructed variable with more options than the ELFE variable: in 
particular MCS had options for mothers with no partner

Also, coding part time work: should I keep an NA for people who don't have jobs?
Should probably, but that would reduce the sample size... Keep an option 2 = no 
job?
Done

1 July 2025 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Spent a lot of time on maternity etc leave. Conclusion: probably should look at
length of leave for both parents. I think in MCS it's sort of assumed that all
mothers take leave, it's more about how long and paid how. In elfe, we have info
on length of maternity leave at 2 months only, which is weird, it's like an idea
of how long it'll be? But then in subsequent surveys, I can keep checking if
they've changed plans and are still on leave.

        For fathers: in MCS, it's weird how many fathers say they've been on 
        leave gain, should I focus on length?
        
        I'll finish coding this variable when I have the complete elfe data

For some reason, 
> elfe[, wgt2m:= M02E_PONDREF]
Error in eval(jsub, SDenv, parent.frame()) : 
  object 'M02E_PONDREF' not found

while the rest is fine:
> elfe[, wgt1y:= A01E_PONDREF]
> elfe[, wgt2y:= A02E_PONDREF]
> elfe[, wgt3y:= A03E_PONDREF]
> elfe[, wgt5y:= A05E_PONDREF]

Started the 2_desc document to get summary statistics for both countries

Need family structure as a variable: done

Started coding the summary statistics

Fix the MCS weights/present in waves variables

2 July 2025 --------------------------------------------------------------------

MCS present in waves variables: not there because I hadn't merged all of the 
hhgrid files
          
          Merging data files again
          Done

Need to fix the denominator of the part-time variable for France: only a ratio
of those working: done

Brain problem just before noon

Back on track: fixed the problems from before lunch, finished typing the
summary statistics code, fixed more issues and...:

Got a nice first version of summary statistics, with pvalues for boy-girl
differences: for the most part no differences between parents of boys and girls,
except for children's access to resources: interesting!

7 July 2025 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Who does what at home variables: for the most part, coded as not applicable if 
family structure different from two parents at home

Finished the bar plots and coef plots for who does what at home

8 July 2025 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished knitting properly

Took care of attitudes/expectations plots

Need some recoding for children's access to resources

# "BPOFRE00"  "BPREOF00" freq "BPREEL00" does anyone : reading do again.   1 is bigger

9 July 2025 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the children's access to resources variables. Why do many missings at age
3 compared to age 5 in MCS? + I left out the frequencies for now: add a never 
category then you can add them

Finished the last set of plots

Should explore more of the frequencies?

Now need to make sense of what's going on + stratify by social class

And fix the maternity leave etc variables, do a set of plots for that too?

11 July 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Coded frequencies of children's access to resources variables in MCS to include
a 0 category for "not at all"

While coding the maternity etc leave variables, found an improvement to make to 
employment variables

Taking a break in data coding

21 July 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Finished coding maternity etc leave, employment and part time vars for ELFE.

Coding them for MCS.
          
          Maternity etc leave 9m: done
          
          UK: fathers take annual leave a lot, a way to take paternity leave?
          for France too?
          
          Maternity leave 3y: contradictory info from two variables, don't know 
          why
          
          Done
          
          Who's working variables also completed for the UK
          
          Need to complete the part time variables for the UK at some point

Regressions with controls for leave and employment: a lot of missingness for
leave for the UK, no missing values for employment
          
          Leave: imputing as 4: no one took leave

22 July 2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Finishing writing data

Double checked the missing values weren't coded as 0s
